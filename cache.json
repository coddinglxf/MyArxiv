In the context of low-resource (LR) MT between two\nclosely-related languages, a natural intuition is to seek benefits from\nstructural \"shortcuts\", such as copying subwords from the source to the target,\ngiven that such language pairs often share a considerable number of identical\nwords, cognates, and borrowings. We test Pointer-Generator Networks for this\npurpose for six language pairs over a variety of resource ranges, and find weak\nimprovements for most settings. However, analysis shows that the model does not\nshow greater improvements for closely-related vs. more distant language pairs,\nor for lower resource ranges, and that the models do not exhibit the expected\nusage of the mechanism for shared subwords. Our discussion of the reasons for\nthis behaviour highlights several general challenges for LR NMT, such as modern\ntokenization strategies, noisy real-world conditions, and linguistic\ncomplexities. We call for better scrutiny of linguistically motivated\nimprovements to NMT given the blackbox nature of Transformer models, as well as\nfor a focus on the above problems in the field.\n","authors":["Niyati Bafna","Philipp Koehn","David Yarowsky"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10963v2.pdf","comment":"4 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16702v1","updated":"2024-03-25T12:34:33Z","published":"2024-03-25T12:34:33Z","title":"ProCQA: A Large-scale Community-based Programming Question Answering\n  Dataset for Code Search","summary":"  Retrieval-based code question answering seeks to match user queries in\nnatural language to relevant code snippets.

Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the\nattention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods\nintroduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring\nadditional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a\ntraining-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking\nmulti-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to\nattend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer\nsequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to\nprocess in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context\nchunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the\ninherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently\ndistributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures\nit can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while\ndifferent heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts.\nLongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that\nuse relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k\nlength on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending\nthe usable context window for existing models.

Our comprehensive\nreview thoroughly analyzes the latest advancements in self-supervised image\ndenoising approaches, categorizing them into three distinct classes: General\nmethods, Blind Spot Network (BSN)-based methods, and Transformer-based methods.\nFor each class, we provide a concise theoretical analysis along with their\npractical applications. To assess the effectiveness of these methods, we\npresent both quantitative and qualitative experimental results on various\ndatasets, utilizing classical algorithms as benchmarks. Additionally, we\ncritically discuss the current limitations of these methods and propose\npromising directions for future research. By offering a detailed overview of\nrecent developments in self-supervised image denoising, this review serves as\nan invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field,\nfacilitating a deeper understanding of this emerging domain and inspiring\nfurther advancements.\n","authors":["Dan Zhang","Fangfang Zhou","Felix Albu","Yuanzhou Wei","Xiao Yang","Yuan Gu","Qiang Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00247v4.pdf","comment":"24 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16539v1","updated":"2024-03-25T08:31:14Z","published":"2024-03-25T08:31:14Z","title":"DOrA: 3D Visual Grounding with Order-Aware Referring","summary":"  3D visual grounding aims to identify the target object within a 3D point\ncloud scene referred to by a natural language description.

Various pretext tasks\nhave been proposed to utilize properties of medical image data (e.g., three\ndimensionality), which are more relevant to medical image analysis than generic\nones for natural images. However, previous work rarely paid attention to data\nwith anatomy-oriented imaging planes, e.g., standard cardiac magnetic resonance\nimaging views.

However, FAC models trained by traditional methodologies can be\nunfair by exhibiting accuracy inconsistencies across varied data\nsubpopulations. This unfairness is largely attributed to bias in data, where\nsome spurious attributes (e.g., Male) statistically correlate with the target\nattribute (e.g., Smiling). Most of existing fairness-aware methods rely on the\nlabels of spurious attributes, which may be unavailable in practice. This work\nproposes a novel, generation-based two-stage framework to train a fair FAC\nmodel on biased data without additional annotation. Initially, we identify the\npotential spurious attributes based on generative models. Notably, it enhances\ninterpretability by explicitly showing the spurious attributes in image space.\nFollowing this, for each image, we first edit the spurious attributes with a\nrandom degree sampled from a uniform distribution, while keeping target\nattribute unchanged.

However, relying\nsolely on cameras is difficult to achieve highly accurate and robust 3D object\ndetection. An effective solution to this issue is combining multi-view cameras\nwith the economical millimeter-wave radar sensor to achieve more reliable\nmulti-modal 3D object detection. In this paper, we introduce RCBEVDet, a\nradar-camera fusion 3D object detection method in the bird's eye view (BEV).\nSpecifically, we first design RadarBEVNet for radar BEV feature extraction.\nRadarBEVNet consists of a dual-stream radar backbone and a Radar Cross-Section\n(RCS) aware BEV encoder. In the dual-stream radar backbone, a point-based\nencoder and a transformer-based encoder are proposed to extract radar features,\nwith an injection and extraction module to facilitate communication between the\ntwo encoders. The RCS-aware BEV encoder takes RCS as the object size prior to\nscattering the point feature in BEV.

Nevertheless, our study reveals that these models still face three\nprimary challenges, prompting us to develop a testbed to facilitate future\nresearch. We introduce a benchmark, LenCom-Eval, specifically designed for\ntesting models' capability in generating images with Lengthy and Complex visual\ntext.

In particular, there is no such work for fisheye cameras, which\nhave high radial distortion and where compression may have higher artifacts.\nFisheye cameras are commonly used in automotive systems for 3D object detection\ntask. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the impact of standard\nvideo compression codecs on wide FOV fisheye camera images. We demonstrate that\nthe achievable compression with negligible impact depends on the dataset and\ntemporal prediction of the video codec. We propose a radial distortion-aware\nzonal metric to evaluate the performance of artifacts in fisheye images. In\naddition, we present a novel method for estimating affine mode parameters of\nthe latest VVC codec, and suggest some areas for improvement in video codecs\nfor the application to fisheye imagery.\n","authors":["Madhumitha Sakthi","Louis Kerofsky","Varun Ravi Kumar","Senthil Yogamani"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16338v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16335v1","updated":"2024-03-25T00:17:43Z","published":"2024-03-25T00:17:43Z","title":"MEDDAP: Medical Dataset Enhancement via Diversified Augmentation\n  Pipeline","summary":"  The effectiveness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) heavily relies on the\nabundance and accuracy of available training data. However, collecting and\nannotating data on a large scale is often both costly and time-intensive,\nparticularly in medical cases where practitioners are already occupied with\ntheir duties. Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various\nscenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when\ndealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different\ndevices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion\n(SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new\ninformative labeled samples. Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based\non natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant\nGPU resources due to their heavy parameters. To overcome this challenge, we\nintroduce USLoRA (Ultrasound Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel fine-tuning method\ntailored specifically for ultrasound applications. USLoRA allows for selective\nfine-tuning of weights within SD, requiring fewer than 0.1\\% of parameters\ncompared to fully fine-tuning only the UNet portion of SD. To enhance dataset\ndiversity, we incorporate different adjectives into the generation process\nprompts, thereby desensitizing the classifiers to intensity changes across\ndifferent images. This approach is inspired by clinicians' decision-making\nprocesses regarding breast tumors, where tumor shape often plays a more crucial\nrole than intensity.

Therefore, recommending notes aligned with user interests has\nbecome a crucial task. Existing online methods only input notes into BERT-based\nmodels to generate note embeddings for assessing similarity. However, they may\nunderutilize some important cues, e.g., hashtags or categories, which represent\nthe key concepts of notes. Indeed, learning to generate hashtags/categories can\npotentially enhance note embeddings, both of which compress key note\ninformation into limited content. Besides, Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nsignificantly outperformed BERT in understanding natural languages. It is\npromising to introduce LLMs into note recommendation. In this paper, we propose\na novel unified framework called NoteLLM, which leverages LLMs to address the\nitem-to-item (I2I) note recommendation. Specifically, we utilize Note\nCompression Prompt to compress a note into a single special token, and further\nlearn the potentially related notes' embeddings via a contrastive learning\napproach. Moreover, we use NoteLLM to summarize the note and generate the\nhashtag/category automatically through instruction tuning.

However, due to\nstructural limitations, existing STGNNs can only utilize short-range traffic\nflow data; therefore, the models cannot adequately learn the complex trends and\nperiodic features in traffic flow. Besides, it is challenging to extract the\nkey temporal information from the long historical traffic series and obtain a\ncompact representation. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel LSTTN\n(Long-Short Term Transformer-based Network) framework comprehensively\nconsidering the long- and short-term features in historical traffic flow.\nFirst, we employ a masked subseries Transformer to infer the content of masked\nsubseries from a small portion of unmasked subseries and their temporal context\nin a pretraining manner, forcing the model to efficiently learn compressed and\ncontextual subseries temporal representations from long historical series.\nThen, based on the learned representations, long-term trend is extracted by\nusing stacked 1D dilated convolution layers, and periodic features are\nextracted by dynamic graph convolution layers. For the difficulties in making\ntime-step level prediction, LSTTN adopts a short-term trend extractor to learn\nfine-grained short-term temporal features.

SEA estimates the attention matrix with\nlinear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates\na sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention\noperation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse\nattention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the\nquadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than\nOPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable\nattention matrix.

Detection of errors is the first step to mitigating their\nimpact on a system and thus, efficient error detection for LLMs is an important\nissue. In many settings, the LLM is considered as a black box with no access to\nthe internal nodes; this prevents the use of many error detection schemes that\nneed access to the model's internal nodes. An interesting observation is that\nthe output of LLMs in error-free operation should be valid and normal text.\nTherefore, when the text is not valid or differs significantly from normal\ntext, it is likely that there is an error. Based on this observation we propose\nto perform Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED); this scheme extracts\nsome linguistic features of the text generated by the LLM and feeds them to a\nconcurrent classifier that detects errors. Since the proposed error detection\nmechanism only relies on the outputs of the model, then it can be used on LLMs\nin which there is no access to the internal nodes. The proposed CLED scheme has\nbeen evaluated on the T5 model when used for news summarization and on the\nOPUS-MT model when used for translation. In both cases, the same set of\nlinguistic features has been used for error detection to illustrate the\napplicability of the proposed scheme beyond a specific case. The results show\nthat CLED can detect most of the errors at a low overhead penalty. The use of\nthe concurrent classifier also enables a trade-off between error detection\neffectiveness and its associated overhead, so providing flexibility to a\ndesigner.\n","authors":["Jinhua Zhu","Javier Conde","Zhen Gao","Pedro Reviriego","Shanshan Liu","Fabrizio Lombardi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16393v1.pdf","comment":"11 pages, 6 figures, 30 references"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16391v1","updated":"2024-03-25T03:13:56Z","published":"2024-03-25T03:13:56Z","title":"Physics-informed RL for Maximal Safety Probability Estimation","summary":"  Accurate risk quantification and reachability analysis are crucial for safe\ncontrol and learning, but sampling from rare events, risky states, or long-term\ntrajectories can be prohibitively costly.

Moreover, ensuring that the model remains robust across various\nscenarios of image capture is crucial in medical domains, especially when\ndealing with ultrasound images that vary based on the settings of different\ndevices and the manual operation of the transducer. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce a novel pipeline called MEDDAP, which leverages Stable Diffusion\n(SD) models to augment existing small datasets by automatically generating new\ninformative labeled samples. Pretrained checkpoints for SD are typically based\non natural images, and training them for medical images requires significant\nGPU resources due to their heavy parameters. To overcome this challenge, we\nintroduce USLoRA (Ultrasound Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel fine-tuning method\ntailored specifically for ultrasound applications. USLoRA allows for selective\nfine-tuning of weights within SD, requiring fewer than 0.1\\% of parameters\ncompared to fully fine-tuning only the UNet portion of SD. To enhance dataset\ndiversity, we incorporate different adjectives into the generation process\nprompts, thereby desensitizing the classifiers to intensity changes across\ndifferent images. This approach is inspired by clinicians' decision-making\nprocesses regarding breast tumors, where tumor shape often plays a more crucial\nrole than intensity.

Although numerous TIReID methods have been proposed and achieved\npromising performance, they implicitly assume the training image-text pairs are\ncorrectly aligned, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios. In\npractice, the image-text pairs inevitably exist under-correlated or even\nfalse-correlated, a.k.a noisy correspondence (NC), due to the low quality of\nthe images and annotation errors.

Nevertheless, the problem is not trivial when\nshaping diffusion models to animate static image (i.e., image-to-video\ngeneration). The difficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion\nprocess of subsequent animated frames should not only preserve the faithful\nalignment with the given image but also pursue temporal coherence among\nadjacent frames. To alleviate this, we present TRIP, a new recipe of\nimage-to-video diffusion paradigm that pivots on image noise prior derived from\nstatic image to jointly trigger inter-frame relational reasoning and ease the\ncoherent temporal modeling via temporal residual learning. Technically, the\nimage noise prior is first attained through one-step backward diffusion process\nbased on both static image and noised video latent codes. Next, TRIP executes a\nresidual-like dual-path scheme for noise prediction: 1) a shortcut path that\ndirectly takes image noise prior as the reference noise of each frame to\namplify the alignment between the first frame and subsequent frames; 2) a\nresidual path that employs 3D-UNet over noised video and static image latent\ncodes to enable inter-frame relational reasoning, thereby easing the learning\nof the residual noise for each frame. Furthermore, both reference and residual\nnoise of each frame are dynamically merged via attention mechanism for final\nvideo generation.

In view of extremely slow convergence in\ntypical DiT, recent breakthroughs have been driven by mask strategy that\nsignificantly improves the training efficiency of DiT with additional\nintra-image contextual learning. Despite this progress, mask strategy still\nsuffers from two inherent limitations: (a) training-inference discrepancy and\n(b) fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction & generative diffusion process,\nresulting in sub-optimal training of DiT. In this work, we address these\nlimitations by novelly unleashing the self-supervised discrimination knowledge\nto boost DiT training. Technically, we frame our DiT in a teacher-student\nmanner.

In particular, by encoding discriminative pairs with\nstudent and teacher DiT encoders, a new discriminative loss is designed to\nencourage the inter-image alignment in the self-supervised embedding space.\nAfter that, student samples are fed into student DiT decoder to perform the\ntypical generative diffusion task.

Commonly, a neural network is trained\nfor this task; however, this requires access to a large, densely annotated\ndataset, which is widely known to be challenging to obtain. To address this\nissue, in this work we propose to predict instance segmentations for 3D scenes\nin an unsupervised way, without relying on ground-truth annotations. To this\nend, we construct a learning framework consisting of two components: (1) a\npseudo-annotation scheme for generating initial unsupervised pseudo-labels; and\n(2) a self-training algorithm for instance segmentation to fit robust, accurate\ninstances from initial noisy proposals. To enable generating 3D instance mask\nproposals, we construct a weighted proxy-graph by connecting 3D points with\nedges integrating multi-modal image- and point-based self-supervised features,\nand perform graph-cuts to isolate individual pseudo-instances. We then build on\na state-of-the-art point-based architecture and train a 3D instance\nsegmentation model, resulting in significant refinement of initial proposals.\nTo scale to arbitrary complexity 3D scenes, we design our algorithm to operate\non local 3D point chunks and construct a merging step to generate scene-level\ninstance segmentations.

However, large datasets pose storage\nchallenges and contain non-influential samples, which could be ignored during\ntraining without impacting the final accuracy of the model. In response to\nthese limitations, the concept of distilling the information on a dataset into\na condensed set of (synthetic) samples, namely a distilled dataset, emerged.\nOne crucial aspect is the selected architecture (usually ConvNet) for linking\nthe original and synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if\nthe employed model architecture differs from the model used during\ndistillation. Another challenge is the generation of high-resolution images,\ne.g., 128x128 and higher. In this paper, we propose Latent Dataset Distillation\nwith Diffusion Models (LD3M) that combine diffusion in latent space with\ndataset distillation to tackle both challenges. LD3M incorporates a novel\ndiffusion process tailored for dataset distillation, which improves the\ngradient norms for learning synthetic images. By adjusting the number of\ndiffusion steps, LD3M also offers a straightforward way of controlling the\ntrade-off between speed and accuracy. We evaluate our approach in several\nImageNet subsets and for high-resolution images (128x128 and 256x256).

A prime exemplification is\nthe recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language\nmodels such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to\nimprove accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial\naspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration\nmethods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical\nfor test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during\ntest-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through\na series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects\nthe calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature\ndispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average\nText Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration\nerror and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT),\nfor optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through\nextensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show\nthat C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning\nwithout needing labeled data.

In the recent time of research, Medical\nImage Computing and Processing has been playing a significant role for\ndetecting and classifying breast cancers from ultrasound images and mammograms,\nalong with the celestial touch of deep neural networks. In this research, we\nfocused mostly on our rigorous implementations and iterative result analysis of\ndifferent cutting-edge modified versions of EfficientNet architectures namely\nEfficientNet-V1 (b0-b7) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0-b3) with ultrasound image,\nnamed as CEIMVEN. We utilized transfer learning approach here for using the\npre-trained models of EfficientNet versions. We activated the hyper-parameter\ntuning procedures, added fully connected layers, discarded the unprecedented\noutliers and recorded the accuracy results from our custom modified\nEfficientNet architectures. Our deep learning model training approach was\nrelated to both identifying the cancer affected areas with region of interest\n(ROI) techniques and multiple classifications (benign, malignant and normal).\nThe approximate testing accuracies we got from the modified versions of\nEfficientNet-V1 (b0- 99.15%, b1- 98.58%, b2- 98.43%, b3- 98.01%, b4- 98.86%,\nb5- 97.72%, b6- 97.72%, b7- 98.72%) and EfficientNet-V2 (b0- 99.29%, b1-\n99.01%, b2- 98.72%, b3- 99.43%) are showing very bright future and strong\npotentials of deep learning approach for the successful detection and\nclassification of breast cancers from the ultrasound images at a very early\nstage.

We make a few main findings\nfrom our analysis. First, there are significant differences in user\ninteractions at the different stages when a user interacts with the MovieLens\nplatform. The early interactions largely define the user portrait which affects\nthe subsequent interactions. Second, user interactions are highly affected by\nthe candidate movies that are recommended by the platform's internal\nrecommendation algorithm(s).

The resulting class of objective functions encapsulates the\nclasses of objective functions traditionally studied in optimization, which are\ndefined based on either Lipschitz continuity of the objective or\nH\\\"{o}lder/Lipschitz continuity of its gradient. Further, the defined class\ncontains functions that are neither Lipschitz continuous nor have a H\\\"{o}lder\ncontinuous gradient. When restricted to the traditional classes of optimization\nproblems, the parameters defining the studied classes lead to more fine-grained\ncomplexity bounds, recovering traditional oracle complexity bounds in the worst\ncase but generally leading to lower oracle complexity for functions that are\nnot ``worst case.'' Some highlights of our results are that: (i) it is possible\nto obtain complexity results for both convex and nonconvex problems with the\n(local or global) Lipschitz constant being replaced by a constant of local\nsubgradient variation and (ii) mean width of the subdifferential set around the\noptima plays a role in the complexity of nonsmooth optimization, particularly\nin parallel settings.

A prime exemplification is\nthe recently proposed test-time prompt tuning for large-scale vision-language\nmodels such as CLIP. Unfortunately, these prompts have been mainly developed to\nimprove accuracy, overlooking the importance of calibration, which is a crucial\naspect for quantifying prediction uncertainty. However, traditional calibration\nmethods rely on substantial amounts of labeled data, making them impractical\nfor test-time scenarios. To this end, this paper explores calibration during\ntest-time prompt tuning by leveraging the inherent properties of CLIP. Through\na series of observations, we find that the prompt choice significantly affects\nthe calibration in CLIP, where the prompts leading to higher text feature\ndispersion result in better-calibrated predictions. Introducing the Average\nText Feature Dispersion (ATFD), we establish its relationship with calibration\nerror and present a novel method, Calibrated Test-time Prompt Tuning (C-TPT),\nfor optimizing prompts during test-time with enhanced calibration. Through\nextensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and datasets, we show\nthat C-TPT can effectively improve the calibration of test-time prompt tuning\nwithout needing labeled data.

Our MMDL system uses RETFound, a\nfoundation model pre-trained on 1.6 million retinal images, for the fundus path\nand a fully connected neural network for the age and gender path. The two paths\nare jointly trained by concatenating the feature vectors from each path that\nare then fed into a fusion network.

However, in many streaming applications, such as streaming\nrecommender systems, online decision-makers typically engage in online learning\nduring the decision-making process, meaning that the interaction history\ngenerated by online decision-makers includes their behavioral evolution from\nnovice expert to experienced expert. This poses a new challenge for existing\nimitation learning approaches that can only utilize data from experienced\nexperts. To address this issue, this paper proposes an inverse batched\ncontextual bandit (IBCB) framework that can efficiently perform estimations of\nenvironment reward parameters and learned policy based on the expert's\nbehavioral evolution history. Specifically, IBCB formulates the inverse problem\ninto a simple quadratic programming problem by utilizing the behavioral\nevolution history of the batched contextual bandit with inaccessible rewards.\nWe demonstrate that IBCB is a unified framework for both deterministic and\nrandomized bandit policies. The experimental results indicate that IBCB\noutperforms several existing imitation learning algorithms on synthetic and\nreal-world data and significantly reduces running time. Additionally, empirical\nanalyses reveal that IBCB exhibits better out-of-distribution generalization\nand is highly effective in learning the bandit policy from the interaction\nhistory of novice experts.\n","authors":["Yi Xu","Weiran Shen","Xiao Zhang","Jun Xu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16075v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16059v1","updated":"2024-03-24T08:06:34Z","published":"2024-03-24T08:06:34Z","title":"Manifold Regularization Classification Model Based On Improved Diffusion\n  Map","summary":"  Manifold regularization model is a semi-supervised learning model that\nleverages the geometric structure of a dataset, comprising a small number of\nlabeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples, to generate\nclassifiers.

Therefore, together with a systematic study of existing lane\ngraph representations, we introduce a novel raster-to-vector autoencoder\n(RVAE). It encodes agents and the lane graph into distinct channels in a\nrasterized latent map. This facilitates both lane-conditioned agent generation\nand combined generation of lanes and agents with a Diffusion Transformer. Using\ngenerated entities in SLEDGE enables greater control over the simulation, e.g.\nupsampling turns or increasing traffic density. Further, SLEDGE can support\n500m long routes, a capability not found in existing data-driven simulators\nlike nuPlan. It presents new challenges for planning algorithms, evidenced by\nfailure rates of over 40% for PDM, the winner of the 2023 nuPlan challenge,\nwhen tested on hard routes and dense traffic generated by our model.

To this end, video summarization has been actively researched to\nenable users to view only important scenes from a video.

Therefore, there is a risk of missing\nimportant information when both the teacher's speech and visual information on\nthe blackboard or slides are important, such as in a lecture video. To tackle\nthis issue, we propose FastPerson, a video summarization approach that\nconsiders both the visual and auditory information in lecture videos.\nFastPerson creates summary videos by utilizing audio transcriptions along with\non-screen images and text, minimizing the risk of overlooking crucial\ninformation for learners.

However, we identify two key\nlimitations in a conventional label assignment for training Transformer-based\nVRD models, which is a process of mapping a ground-truth (GT) to a prediction.\nUnder the conventional assignment, an unspecialized query is trained since a\nquery is expected to detect every relation, which makes it difficult for a\nquery to specialize in specific relations. Furthermore, a query is also\ninsufficiently trained since a GT is assigned only to a single prediction,\ntherefore near-correct or even correct predictions are suppressed by being\nassigned no relation as a GT.

In contrast to temporal compositions that seek to transition\nfrom one action to another, spatial compositing requires understanding which\nbody parts are involved in which action, to be able to move them\nsimultaneously. Motivated by the observation that the correspondence between\nactions and body parts is encoded in powerful language models, we extract this\nknowledge by prompting GPT-3 with text such as \"what are the body parts\ninvolved in the action <action name>?\", while also providing the parts list and\nfew-shot examples.

This\napproach aims to enhance the model's generalization capabilities by exposing it\nto more challenging classification tasks during meta-training and evaluating it\non easier tasks but holding greater clinical relevance during meta-testing. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through a series of\nexperiments exploring several backbones, as well as diverse pre-training and\nfine-tuning schemes, on two distinct medical tasks, i.e., classification of\nprostate cancer aggressiveness from MRI data and classification of breast\ncancer malignity from microscopic images. Results: Our results indicate that\nthe proposed approach consistently yields superior performance w.r.t. ablation\nexperiments, maintaining competitiveness even when a distribution shift between\ntraining and evaluation data occurs.

The\nDS-AL contains a main stream offering an analytical (i.e., closed-form) linear\nsolution, and a compensation stream improving the inherent under-fitting\nlimitation due to adopting linear mapping. The main stream redefines the CIL\nproblem into a Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) task, allowing an\nequivalence between the CIL and its joint-learning counterpart. The\ncompensation stream is governed by a Dual-Activation Compensation (DAC) module.\nThis module re-activates the embedding with a different activation function\nfrom the main stream one, and seeks fitting compensation by projecting the\nembedding to the null space of the main stream's linear mapping.

Accordingly,\nthe existing body of work on news recommendation suffers from a lack of\npublicly available multilingual benchmarks that would catalyze development of\nnews recommenders effective in multilingual settings and for low-resource\nlanguages. Aiming to fill this gap, we introduce xMIND, an open, multilingual\nnews recommendation dataset derived from the English MIND dataset using machine\ntranslation, covering a set of 14 linguistically and geographically diverse\nlanguages, with digital footprints of varying sizes. Using xMIND, we\nsystematically benchmark several state-of-the-art content-based neural news\nrecommenders (NNRs) in both zero-shot (ZS-XLT) and few-shot (FS-XLT)\ncross-lingual transfer scenarios, considering both monolingual and bilingual\nnews consumption patterns.

These core conversions are\nusually continuous targets, such as \\textit{watch time}, \\textit{revenue}, and\nso on, whose predictions can be enhanced by previous discrete conversion\nactions. Therefore, multi-task learning (MTL) can be adopted as the paradigm to\nlearn these hybrid targets.

Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in\nassessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and\nmitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit\nnon-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt\ndisplaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify\nbenchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on\nimbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a\nrepresentation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference\ntime. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using\nprompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal\nrepresentations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to\nproduce the final debiased outputs. Experiments across various prompts, PLMs,\nand benchmarks show that our approach can not only correct the overfitted\nperformance caused by prompt bias, but also significantly improve the prompt\nretrieval capability (up to 10% absolute performance gain). These results\nindicate that our approach effectively alleviates prompt bias in knowledge\nevaluation, thereby enhancing the reliability of benchmark assessments.\nHopefully, our plug-and-play approach can be a golden standard to strengthen\nPLMs toward reliable knowledge bases.

In more detail, we\nprove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary quantum hypothesis testing\ndepends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the\nnegative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's\nlemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary quantum\nhypothesis testing depends logarithmically on the inverse type~II error\nprobability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy. Finally, we provide\nlower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple quantum hypothesis\ntesting, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds.\n","authors":["Hao-Chung Cheng","Nilanjana Datta","Nana Liu","Theshani Nuradha","Robert Salzmann","Mark M.

Grasp guidance takes a single\ntarget grasping pose and guides the diffusion model to reach this grasp at the\nend of the grasping stage, which provides control over the grasping pose. Given\na grasping motion from this stage, multiple different actions can be prompted\nin the interaction phase. For textual guidance, we contribute comprehensive\ntext descriptions to the GRAB dataset and show that they enable our method to\nhave more fine-grained control over hand-object interactions. Our quantitative\nand qualitative evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms\nbaseline methods and leads to natural hand-object motions. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate the practicality of our framework by utilizing a hand pose estimate\nfrom an off-the-shelf pose estimator for guidance, and then sampling multiple\ndifferent actions in the interaction stage.\n","authors":["Sammy Christen","Shreyas Hampali","Fadime Sener","Edoardo Remelli","Tomas Hodan","Eric Sauser","Shugao Ma","Bugra Tekin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17827v1.pdf","comment":"Project Page: https://diffh2o.github.io/"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15964v2","updated":"2024-03-26T15:58:26Z","published":"2023-11-27T16:07:37Z","title":"Efficient Pre-training for Localized Instruction Generation of Videos","summary":"  Procedural videos show step-by-step demonstrations of tasks like recipe\npreparation.

These approaches do not\ninvestigate or employ multiple kernel functions to address the extrapolation\nchallenge. Drawing on the ALiBi approach, this study proposes a novel relative\npositional encoding method, called MEP, which employs a weighted average to\ncombine distinct kernel functions(such as the exponential kernel and the\nGaussian kernel) to generate a bias that is applied to post-softmax attention\nscores. Initially, the framework utilizes various kernel functions to construct\nmultiple kernel functions.

However, this assumption\ncan be easily violated in real-world applications, leading to the\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) problem. Understanding how modern over-parameterized\nDNNs behave under non-trivial natural distributional shifts is essential, as\ncurrent theoretical understanding is insufficient. Existing theoretical works\noften provide meaningless results for over-parameterized models in OOD\nscenarios or even contradict empirical findings. To this end, we are\ninvestigating the performance of the over-parameterized model in terms of OOD\ngeneralization under the general benign overfitting conditions. Our analysis\nfocuses on a random feature model and examines non-trivial natural\ndistributional shifts, where the benign overfitting estimators demonstrate a\nconstant excess OOD loss, despite achieving zero excess in-distribution (ID)\nloss. We demonstrate that in this scenario, further increasing the model's\nparameterization can significantly reduce the OOD loss. Intuitively, the\nvariance term of ID loss remains low due to orthogonality of long-tail\nfeatures, meaning overfitting noise during training generally doesn't raise\ntesting loss. However, in OOD cases, distributional shift increases the\nvariance term. Thankfully, the inherent shift is unrelated to individual x,\nmaintaining the orthogonality of long-tail features. Expanding the hidden\ndimension can additionally improve this orthogonality by mapping the features\ninto higher-dimensional spaces, thereby reducing the variance term. We further\nshow that model ensembles also improve OOD loss, akin to increasing model\ncapacity.

Existing methods adhering to this constraint\nare prone to catastrophic forgetting, far more so than replay-based techniques\nthat retain access to past samples. In this paper, to solve the exemplar-free\nCIL problem, we propose a Dual-Stream Analytic Learning (DS-AL) approach. The\nDS-AL contains a main stream offering an analytical (i.e., closed-form) linear\nsolution, and a compensation stream improving the inherent under-fitting\nlimitation due to adopting linear mapping. The main stream redefines the CIL\nproblem into a Concatenated Recursive Least Squares (C-RLS) task, allowing an\nequivalence between the CIL and its joint-learning counterpart. The\ncompensation stream is governed by a Dual-Activation Compensation (DAC) module.\nThis module re-activates the embedding with a different activation function\nfrom the main stream one, and seeks fitting compensation by projecting the\nembedding to the null space of the main stream's linear mapping.

In recent years, imitation learning that\naims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable\nalternative to solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning\nis designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the\nbehavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in\nimitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation\nprimarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the\nvehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is\ngoverned not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints. For\ninstance, decisions on self-driving delivery vehicles are dependent not only on\nthe route preferences/rewards (depending on past demand data) but also on the\nfuel in the vehicle and the time available. In such problems, imitation\nlearning is challenging as decisions are not only dictated by the reward model\nbut are also dependent on a cost-constrained model. In this paper, we provide\nmultiple methods that match expert distributions in the presence of trajectory\ncost constraints through (a) Lagrangian-based method; (b) Meta-gradients to\nfind a good trade-off between expected return and minimizing constraint\nviolation; and (c) Cost-violation-based alternating gradient.

This paper presents an\napproach to this sequence-to-sequence problem by introducing the District\nGuided Tokens (DGT) technique on a new dataset spanning six districts of\nBangladesh. The key idea is to provide the model with explicit information\nabout the regional dialect or \"district\" of the input text before generating\nthe IPA transcription.

In this paper, we propose novel semantic\ndata augmentation methods, Novel Augmentation of New Node Attributes (NaNa),\nand Molecular Interactions and Geometric Upgrading (MiGu) to incorporate\nbackbone chemical and side-chain biophysical information into protein\nclassification tasks and a co-embedding residual learning framework.\nSpecifically, we leverage molecular biophysical, secondary structure, chemical\nbonds, and ionic features of proteins to facilitate protein classification\ntasks. Furthermore, our semantic augmentation methods and the co-embedding\nresidual learning framework can improve the performance of GIN (Xu et al.,\n2019) on EC and Fold datasets (Bairoch, 2000; Andreeva et al., 2007) by 16.41%\nand 11.33% respectively.

Therefore, there is a risk of missing\nimportant information when both the teacher's speech and visual information on\nthe blackboard or slides are important, such as in a lecture video. To tackle\nthis issue, we propose FastPerson, a video summarization approach that\nconsiders both the visual and auditory information in lecture videos.\nFastPerson creates summary videos by utilizing audio transcriptions along with\non-screen images and text, minimizing the risk of overlooking crucial\ninformation for learners. Further, it provides a feature that allows learners\nto switch between the summary and original videos for each chapter of the\nvideo, enabling them to adjust the pace of learning based on their interests\nand level of understanding.

Most existing\napproaches are tailored for a specific setting and can only cater to one or two\nof these paradigms. In this paper, we introduce a versatile adaptation approach\nthat can effectively work under all three settings.

Considering speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g.,\ncontent, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant\nchallenges for generation, a natural idea is to factorize speech into\nindividual subspaces representing different attributes and generate them\nindividually. Motivated by it, we propose NaturalSpeech 3, a TTS system with\nnovel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot\nway. Specifically, 1) we design a neural codec with factorized vector\nquantization (FVQ) to disentangle speech waveform into subspaces of content,\nprosody, timbre, and acoustic details; 2) we propose a factorized diffusion\nmodel to generate attributes in each subspace following its corresponding\nprompt. With this factorization design, NaturalSpeech 3 can effectively and\nefficiently model intricate speech with disentangled subspaces in a\ndivide-and-conquer way. Experiments show that NaturalSpeech 3 outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art TTS systems on quality, similarity, prosody, and\nintelligibility, and achieves on-par quality with human recordings.\nFurthermore, we achieve better performance by scaling to 1B parameters and 200K\nhours of training data.\n","authors":["Zeqian Ju","Yuancheng Wang","Kai Shen","Xu Tan","Detai Xin","Dongchao Yang","Yanqing Liu","Yichong Leng","Kaitao Song","Siliang Tang","Zhizheng Wu","Tao Qin","Xiang-Yang Li","Wei Ye","Shikun Zhang","Jiang Bian","Lei He","Jinyu Li","Sheng Zhao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03100v2.pdf","comment":"Achieving human-level quality and naturalness on multi-speaker\n  datasets (e.g., LibriSpeech) in a zero-shot way"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18715v1","updated":"2024-03-27T16:04:47Z","published":"2024-03-27T16:04:47Z","title":"Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models with\n  Instruction Contrastive Decoding","summary":"  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly adept at generating\ncontextually detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs.

The main\nchallenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the\nsetting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields,\nwhich have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and\ngeometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\\\"ively supervising\nthem on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view\ninputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and\nhigh-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or\neven a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance\nfield weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve\nas a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This\nprior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively\naddressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure\nof the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a\nprior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in\na pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes\nfeature learning more effective. Consequently, one can fine-tune our field\nparameters to quickly generalize to unseen poses, novel illumination conditions\nas well as novel and sparse (even monocular) camera views.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number\nof learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of\ntoken quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19\nclassification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense\ntasks.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We\nempirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple\nimage classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity\neffect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation\neffort.

Most\nmethods maintain consistent predictions of the unlabeled images under\nvariations (e.g., adding noise/perturbations, or creating alternative versions)\nin the image and/or model level. In most image-level variation, medical images\noften have prior structure information, which has not been well explored. In\nthis paper, we propose novel dual structure-aware image filterings (DSAIF) as\nthe image-level variations for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.\nMotivated by connected filtering that simplifies image via filtering in\nstructure-aware tree-based image representation, we resort to the dual contrast\ninvariant Max-tree and Min-tree representation.

This results in\ntwo filtered images preserving topologically critical structure. Applying the\nproposed DSAIF to mutually supervised networks decreases the consensus of their\nerroneous predictions on unlabeled images.

This approach, coupled with\nstrategic cross-LoRA feature and attention injection, guides the style transfer\nprocess. The foundation of our methodology is rooted in the observation that\nLoRA maintains the spatial feature consistency of UNet, a discovery that\nfurther inspired the development of a mask-wise style transfer technique. This\ntechnique employs masks extracted through a pre-trained FastSAM model,\nutilizing mask prompts to facilitate feature fusion during the denoising\nprocess, thereby enabling localized style transfer that preserves the original\nimage's unaffected regions. Moreover, our approach accommodates multiple style\ntargets through the use of corresponding masks. Through extensive\nexperimentation, we demonstrate that DiffStyler surpasses previous methods in\nachieving a more harmonious balance between content preservation and style\nintegration.\n","authors":["Shaoxu Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18461v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10522v4","updated":"2024-03-27T11:18:51Z","published":"2023-11-17T13:43:43Z","title":"Enhancing Object Coherence in Layout-to-Image Synthesis","summary":"  Layout-to-image synthesis is an emerging technique in conditional image\ngeneration. It aims to generate complex scenes, where users require fine\ncontrol over the layout of the objects in a scene. However, it remains\nchallenging to control the object coherence, including semantic coherence\n(e.g., the cat looks at the flowers or not) and physical coherence (e.g., the\nhand and the racket should not be misaligned). In this paper, we propose a\nnovel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and\nself-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for\nthis task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains\nrich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in\nthe images. Instead of simply employing cross-attention between captions and\ngenerated images, which addresses the highly relevant layout restriction and\nsemantic coherence separately and thus leads to unsatisfying results shown in\nour experiments, we develop GSF to fuse the supervision from the layout\nrestriction and semantic coherence requirement and exploit it to guide the\nimage synthesis process. Moreover, to improve the physical coherence, we\ndevelop a Self-similarity Coherence Attention (SCA) module to explicitly\nintegrate local contextual physical coherence into each pixel's generation\nprocess. Specifically, we adopt a self-similarity map to encode the coherence\nrestrictions and employ it to extract coherent features from text embedding.\nThrough visualization of our self-similarity map, we explore the essence of\nSCA, revealing that its effectiveness is not only in capturing reliable\nphysical coherence patterns but also in enhancing complex texture generation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in\nboth image generation quality and controllability.\n","authors":["Yibin Wang","Weizhong Zhang","Jianwei Zheng","Cheng Jin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10522v4.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18454v1","updated":"2024-03-27T11:13:20Z","published":"2024-03-27T11:13:20Z","title":"Scaling Vision-and-Language Navigation With Offline RL","summary":"  The study of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) has typically relied on\nexpert trajectories, which may not always be available in real-world situations\ndue to the significant effort required to collect them.

Initially, we transform a video into a\nsingle composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The\nresulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while\nmaintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal\ninformation within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach\nenables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without\nnecessitating any video-data training. Our extensive experimental analysis\nacross ten zero-shot video question answering benchmarks, including five\nopen-ended and five multiple-choice benchmarks, reveals that the proposed Image\nGrid Vision Language Model (IG-VLM) surpasses the existing methods in nine out\nof ten benchmarks.\n","authors":["Wonkyun Kim","Changin Choi","Wonseok Lee","Wonjong Rhee"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18406v1.pdf","comment":"Our code is available at https://github.com/imagegridworth/IG-VLM"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05262v2","updated":"2024-03-27T09:43:41Z","published":"2024-03-08T12:35:07Z","title":"Debiasing Multimodal Large Language Models","summary":"  In the realms of computer vision and natural language processing, Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become indispensable tools, proficient in\ngenerating textual descriptions based on visual inputs. Despite their\nadvancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias in the generated\ncontent, where the output is primarily influenced by the underlying Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) prior rather than the input image. Our empirical\nexperiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as LVLMs often provide\nconfident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent\nvisual input. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward\nvision information, we introduce two simple, training-free strategies. Firstly,\nfor tasks such as classification or multi-choice question-answering (QA), we\npropose a ``calibration'' step through affine transformation to adjust the\noutput distribution. This ``Post-Hoc debias'' approach ensures uniform scores\nfor each answer when the image is absent, serving as an effective\nregularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more\nintricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to ``Debias\nsampling'', drawing inspirations from contrastive decoding methods.\nFurthermore, our investigation sheds light on the instability of LVLMs across\nvarious decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different\nsettings, we significantly enhance performance, surpassing reported results and\nraising concerns about the fairness of existing evaluations.

They align the\ndistribution differences between domains as encoders without considering their\nunique characteristics. For instance, ViT excels in accuracy due to its\nsuperior ability to capture global representations, while CNN has an advantage\nin capturing local representations. This fact has led us to design a hybrid\nmethod to fully take advantage of both ViT and CNN, called Explicitly\nClass-specific Boundaries (ECB). ECB learns CNN on ViT to combine their\ndistinct strengths. In particular, we leverage ViT's properties to explicitly\nfind class-specific decision boundaries by maximizing the discrepancy between\nthe outputs of the two classifiers to detect target samples far from the source\nsupport. In contrast, the CNN encoder clusters target features based on the\npreviously defined class-specific boundaries by minimizing the discrepancy\nbetween the probabilities of the two classifiers. Finally, ViT and CNN mutually\nexchange knowledge to improve the quality of pseudo labels and reduce the\nknowledge discrepancies of these models.

While existing 3D hair modeling\nmethods have achieved impressive performance, the challenge of achieving\nhigh-quality hair reconstruction persists: they either require strict capture\nconditions, making practical applications difficult, or heavily rely on learned\nprior data, obscuring fine-grained details in images. To address these\nchallenges, we propose MonoHair,a generic framework to achieve high-fidelity\nhair reconstruction from a monocular video, without specific requirements for\nenvironments. Our approach bifurcates the hair modeling process into two main\nstages: precise exterior reconstruction and interior structure inference. The\nexterior is meticulously crafted using our Patch-based Multi-View Optimization\n(PMVO). This method strategically collects and integrates hair information from\nmultiple views, independent of prior data, to produce a high-fidelity exterior\n3D line map. This map not only captures intricate details but also facilitates\nthe inference of the hair's inner structure. For the interior, we employ a\ndata-driven, multi-view 3D hair reconstruction method. This method utilizes 2D\nstructural renderings derived from the reconstructed exterior, mirroring the\nsynthetic 2D inputs used during training. This alignment effectively bridges\nthe domain gap between our training data and real-world data, thereby enhancing\nthe accuracy and reliability of our interior structure inference. Lastly, we\ngenerate a strand model and resolve the directional ambiguity by our hair\ngrowth algorithm.

Recent studies have investigated various approaches to\noptimize the fusion of modality-specific features for enhancing joint\nrepresentations.

Meanwhile, owing to the use of an embedding\ntable to represent each user/item as a distinct vector, GNN-based recommenders\nhave inherited the long-standing defect of parameter inefficiency. As a common\npractice for scalable embeddings, parameter sharing enables the use of fewer\nembedding vectors (i.e., meta-embeddings). When assigning meta-embeddings, most\nexisting methods are a heuristically designed, predefined mapping from each\nuser's/item's ID to the corresponding meta-embedding indexes, thus simplifying\nthe optimization problem into learning only the meta-embeddings.

Most of the existing works focus on improving\nthe representation ability for the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token\nand calculate relevance using textual semantic similarity. However, in the\nlegal domain, textual semantic similarity does not always imply that the cases\nare relevant enough. Instead, relevance in legal cases primarily depends on the\nsimilarity of key facts that impact the final judgment. Without proper\ntreatments, the discriminative ability of learned representations could be\nlimited since legal cases are lengthy and contain numerous non-key facts. To\nthis end, we introduce DELTA, a discriminative model designed for legal case\nretrieval. The basic idea involves pinpointing key facts in legal cases and\npulling the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token closer to the key facts\nwhile pushing away from the non-key facts, which can warm up the case embedding\nspace in an unsupervised manner. To be specific, this study brings the word\nalignment mechanism to the contextual masked auto-encoder. First, we leverage\nshallow decoders to create information bottlenecks, aiming to enhance the\nrepresentation ability.

This poses several unique challenges for click-through rate (CTR)\nprediction. Due to limited user interactions for each product (i.e. item), the\ncorresponding item embedding in the CTR model may not easily converge. This\nmakes the conventional sequence modeling based approaches cannot effectively\nutilize user history information since historical user behaviors contain a\nmixture of items with different volume of stocks. Particularly, the attention\nmechanism in a sequence model tends to assign higher score to products with\nmore accumulated user interactions, making limited-stock products being ignored\nand contribute less to the final output. To this end, we propose the Meta-Split\nNetwork (MSNet) to split user history sequence regarding to the volume of stock\nfor each product, and adopt differentiated modeling approaches for different\nsequences. As for the limited-stock products, a meta-learning approach is\napplied to address the problem of inconvergence, which is achieved by designing\nmeta scaling and shifting networks with ID and side information. In addition,\ntraditional approach can hardly update item embedding once the product is\nconsumed. Thereby, we propose an auxiliary loss that makes the parameters\nupdatable even when the product is no longer in distribution. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first solution addressing the recommendation of\nlimited-stock product.

Traditional\nsequential recommendation methods rely on capturing implicit collaborative\nfiltering signals among items. Recent relation-aware sequential recommendation\nmodels have achieved promising performance by explicitly incorporating item\nrelations into the modeling of user historical sequences, where most relations\nare extracted from knowledge graphs. However, existing methods rely on manually\npredefined relations and suffer the sparsity issue, limiting the generalization\nability in diverse scenarios with varied item relations. In this paper, we\npropose a novel relation-aware sequential recommendation framework with Latent\nRelation Discovery (LRD). Different from previous relation-aware models that\nrely on predefined rules, we propose to leverage the Large Language Model (LLM)\nto provide new types of relations and connections between items. The motivation\nis that LLM contains abundant world knowledge, which can be adopted to mine\nlatent relations of items for recommendation. Specifically, inspired by that\nhumans can describe relations between items using natural language, LRD\nharnesses the LLM that has demonstrated human-like knowledge to obtain language\nknowledge representations of items. These representations are fed into a latent\nrelation discovery module based on the discrete state variational autoencoder\n(DVAE). Then the self-supervised relation discovery tasks and recommendation\ntasks are jointly optimized. Experimental results on multiple public datasets\ndemonstrate our proposed latent relations discovery method can be incorporated\nwith existing relation-aware sequential recommendation models and significantly\nimprove the performance.

One common issue in real RS is the\ncold-start problem, where users and items may not contain enough information to\nproduce high-quality recommendations. This work focuses on a complementary\nproblem: recommending new users and items unseen (out-of-vocabulary, or OOV) at\ntraining time. This setting is known as the inductive setting and is especially\nproblematic for factorization-based models, which rely on encoding only those\nusers/items seen at training time with fixed parameter vectors.

We discuss general-purpose plug-and-play\napproaches that are easily applicable to most RS models and improve inductive\nperformance without negatively impacting transductive model performance.

To solve image\nrestoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by\nincorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling\nprocess of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a\nchallenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large\ncomputational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present\nadditional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the\nnumber of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling\nsteps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration\nsolver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the\ndata consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a\nreconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that\nenforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates\nversatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent\nspace. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps\nthrough the integration of consistency models.

Due to multimodal sensors equipped by the LEO satellites, they serve\nnot only for communication but also for various machine learning applications,\nsuch as space modulation recognition, remote sensing image classification, etc.\nHowever, the ground station (GS) may be incapable of downloading such a large\nvolume of raw sensing data for centralized model training due to the limited\ncontact time with LEO satellites (e.g. 5 minutes).

The presented\nmethodology is based on conventional neural network-based survival models that\nare trained using data that is continuously gathered and stored at specific\ntimes, called snapshots. An important property of this type of training data is\nthat it can contain more than one snapshot from a specific individual which\nresults in that standard maximum likelihood training can not be directly\napplied since the data is not independent. However, the papers show that if the\ndata is in a specific format where all snapshot times are the same for all\nindividuals, called homogeneously sampled, maximum likelihood training can be\napplied and produce desirable results. In many cases, the data is not\nhomogeneously sampled and in this case, it is proposed to resample the data to\nmake it homogeneously sampled. How densely the dataset is sampled turns out to\nbe an important parameter; it should be chosen large enough to produce good\nresults, but this also increases the size of the dataset which makes training\nslow. To reduce the number of samples needed during training, the paper also\nproposes a technique to, instead of resampling the dataset once before the\ntraining starts, randomly resample the dataset at the start of each epoch\nduring the training. The proposed methodology is evaluated on both a simulated\ndataset and an experimental dataset of starter battery failures.

However, this centralized architecture is limited by the\nproliferation of data sources and the growing demand for timely analysis and\nprocessing. A new data paradigm, Data Mesh, is proposed to overcome these\nchallenges. Data Mesh treats domains as a first-class concern by distributing\nthe data ownership from the central team to each data domain, while keeping the\nfederated governance to monitor domains and their data products. Many\nmulti-million dollar organizations like Paypal, Netflix, and Zalando have\nalready transformed their data analysis pipelines based on this new\narchitecture. In this decentralized architecture where data is locally\npreserved by each domain team, traditional centralized machine learning is\nincapable of conducting effective analysis across multiple domains, especially\nfor security-sensitive organizations. To this end, we introduce a pioneering\napproach that incorporates Federated Learning into Data Mesh.

These approaches face two key\nchallenges. First, training deep learning neural networks requires large\namounts of training data which are not yet easily available for traffic flow\nsystems. Second, even when data is available, the neural networks require\naccess to historical data that covers most possible traffic flow dynamics to\nsuccessfully predict future traffic states. Specifically, these deep learning\napproaches do not fully leverage domain-knowledge about traffic flow dynamics,\ndespite a significant existing knowledge-base. In this work, we propose to\nsolve both issues using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) with Long Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM) deep learning architecture to successfully predict traffic\nflow, while leveraging a cellular automata-based statistical mechanics model of\ntraffic flow to generate training and test data. Another major contribution of\nthis paper is the insight that training data for a large traffic system can\nactually be sampled from the simulations of a much smaller traffic system. This\nis achieved through observing that the normalized energy distribution of the\nstatistical mechanics model is scale invariant, which significantly eases the\nburden of data generation for large scale traffic systems.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a conditional Wasserstein distance via a set of restricted couplings\nthat equals the expected Wasserstein distance of the posteriors.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,\nour proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the\nmaximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time\nanalysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular,\nwe show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by\n$\\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here,\n$\\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations. Moreover, the\nadaptive scheme requires no prior knowledge of the delay sequence for step-size\ntuning.

The effects of such heterogeneity\nplay an important role for tissue function, and hence it is of critical to\ndiscover and understand the distribution of such fiber orientations from\nexperimental measurements, such as the digital image correlation data. To this\nend, we introduce the heterogeneous peridynamic neural operator (HeteroPNO)\napproach, for data-driven constitutive modeling of heterogeneous anisotropic\nmaterials. The goal is to learn both a nonlocal constitutive law together with\nthe material microstructure, in the form of a heterogeneous fiber orientation\nfield, from loading field-displacement field measurements. To this end, we\npropose a two-phase learning approach.

Then, in the second phase we reinitialize the learnt bond force and the\nkernel function, and training them together with a fiber orientation field for\neach material point. Owing to the state-based peridynamic skeleton, our\nHeteroPNO-learned material models are objective and have the balance of linear\nand angular momentum guaranteed. Moreover, the effects from heterogeneity and\nnonlinear constitutive relationship are captured by the kernel function and the\nbond force respectively, enabling physical interpretability.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We\nempirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple\nimage classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity\neffect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation\neffort.

Inspired by the recent success of language\nfoundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal\nTrajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort\nof question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression\nmodels, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals,\nwe consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first\ntransform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural\nlanguage space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are\nconverted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text\ninformation through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data\nare then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language\nmodel. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning\nhigh-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between\npedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We\nthen train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the\ntokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to\ncapture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model.\nLastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of\nthe question-answer prompts.

Firstly, they often rely on Euclidean distance to measure\nsimilarity when constructing the adaptive neighbor graph, which proves\ninadequate in capturing the intrinsic structure among data points in many\nreal-world scenarios.

However, transitioning from discriminative to\ngenerative models requires addressing two key challenges. The primary challenge\nlies in transferring the generated textual information into the classification\nof distinct categories.

It typically involves a set of heterogeneous devices locally\ntraining neural network (NN) models in parallel with periodic centralized\naggregations. As some of the devices may have limited computational resources\nand varying availability, FL latency is highly sensitive to stragglers.\nConventional approaches discard incomplete intra-model updates done by\nstragglers, alter the amount of local workload and architecture, or resort to\nasynchronous settings; which all affect the trained model performance under\ntight training latency constraints. In this work, we propose straggler-aware\nlayer-wise federated learning (SALF) that leverages the optimization procedure\nof NNs via backpropagation to update the global model in a layer-wise fashion.\nSALF allows stragglers to synchronously convey partial gradients, having each\nlayer of the global model be updated independently with a different\ncontributing set of users. We provide a theoretical analysis, establishing\nconvergence guarantees for the global model under mild assumptions on the\ndistribution of the participating devices, revealing that SALF converges at the\nsame asymptotic rate as FL with no timing limitations.

Existing world models are autoregressive in that they\ninterleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the\npolicy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows.\nIn this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not\nautoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass\nthrough a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion\n(PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the\naction distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random\nstates and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the\nconnections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and\nclassifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error\nfor short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For\nshort trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive\ndiffusion, but with lower computational requirements.

However, feature asynchronism and\nsparsity cause invisible objects due to no relative motion to the camera,\nposing a significant challenge in the task. Prior works have studied various\nmemory mechanisms to preserve as many features as possible at the current time,\nguided by temporal clues. While these implicit-learned memories retain some\nshort-term information, they still struggle to preserve long-term features\neffectively. In this paper, we consider those invisible objects as\npseudo-occluded objects and aim to reveal their features. Firstly, we introduce\nvisibility attribute of objects and contribute an auto-labeling algorithm to\nappend additional visibility labels on an existing event camera dataset.\nSecondly, we exploit tracking strategies for pseudo-occluded objects to\nmaintain their permanence and retain their bounding boxes, even when features\nhave not been available for a very long time. These strategies can be treated\nas an explicit-learned memory guided by the tracking objective to record the\ndisplacements of objects across frames. Lastly, we propose a spatio-temporal\nfeature aggregation module to enrich the latent features and a consistency loss\nto increase the robustness of the overall pipeline. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments to verify our method's effectiveness where still objects are\nretained but real occluded objects are discarded.

However,\nthis approach suffers from weak labelling, since the ground-truth\nhistopathology labels do not describe the properties of individual ROIs.\nRecently, multi-scale approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by\ncombining the context awareness of transformers with a CNN feature extractor to\ndetect cancer from multiple ROIs using multiple-instance learning (MIL). In\nthis work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer\narchitectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a\ncomparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based\nprostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to further mitigate label\nnoise. METHODS: We evaluate 3 image transformers on ROI-scale cancer\nclassification, then use the strongest model to tune a multi-scale classifier\nwith MIL. We train our MIL models using our novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy and compare our results to existing baselines. RESULTS: We find that\nfor both ROI-scale and multi-scale PCa detection, image transformer backbones\nlag behind their CNN counterparts.

Experimental\nresults show that Penance consumes a negligible 6.8% more computation resources\nthan the optimal strategy while satisfying accuracy and bandwidth constraints\nwith a low failure rate.\n","authors":["Mingxuan Yan","Yi Wang","Xuedou Xiao","Zhiqing Luo","Jianhua He","Wei Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14326v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18323v1","updated":"2024-03-27T07:52:51Z","published":"2024-03-27T07:52:51Z","title":"How to Cache Important Contents for Multi-modal Service in Dynamic\n  Networks: A DRL-based Caching Scheme","summary":"  With the continuous evolution of networking technologies, multi-modal\nservices that involve video, audio, and haptic contents are expected to become\nthe dominant multimedia service in the near future. Edge caching is a key\ntechnology that can significantly reduce network load and content transmission\nlatency, which is critical for the delivery of multi-modal contents. However,\nexisting caching approaches only rely on a limited number of factors, e.g.,\npopularity, to evaluate their importance for caching, which is inefficient for\ncaching multi-modal contents, especially in dynamic network environments. To\novercome this issue, we propose a content importance-based caching scheme which\nconsists of a content importance evaluation model and a caching model. By\nleveraging dueling double deep Q networks (D3QN) model, the content importance\nevaluation model can adaptively evaluate contents' importance in dynamic\nnetworks. Based on the evaluated contents' importance, the caching model can\neasily cache and evict proper contents to improve caching efficiency. The\nsimulation results show that the proposed content importance-based caching\nscheme outperforms existing caching schemes in terms of caching hit ratio (at\nleast 15% higher), reduced network load (up to 22% reduction), average number\nof hops (up to 27% lower), and unsatisfied requests ratio (more than 47%\nreduction).\n","authors":["Zhe Zhang","Marc St-Hilaire","Xin Wei","Haiwei Dong","Abdulmotaleb El Saddik"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18323v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18252v1","updated":"2024-03-27T04:49:23Z","published":"2024-03-27T04:49:23Z","title":"Beyond Embeddings: The Promise of Visual Table in Multi-Modal Models","summary":"  Visual representation learning has been a cornerstone in computer vision,\nevolving from supervised learning with human-annotated labels to aligning\nimage-text pairs from the Internet. Despite recent advancements in multi-modal\nlarge language models (MLLMs), the visual representations they rely on, such as\nCLIP embeddings, often lack access to external world knowledge critical for\nreal-world visual reasoning. In this work, we propose Visual Table, a novel\nvisual representation tailored for MLLMs. It provides hierarchical text\ndescriptions of holistic visual scenes, consisting of a scene description and\nmultiple object-centric descriptions that encompass categories, attributes, and\nknowledge at instance level. We further develop a scalable generator for visual\ntable generation and train it on small-scale annotations from GPT4V. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrate that, with generated visual tables as additional visual\nrepresentations, our model can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) MLLMs across diverse benchmarks. When visual tables serve as standalone\nvisual representations, our model can closely match or even beat the SOTA MLLMs\nthat are built on CLIP visual embeddings.

However, learning-based NR-PCQA methods suffer from\nthe scarcity of labeled data and usually perform suboptimally in terms of\ngeneralization. To solve the problem, we propose a novel contrastive\npre-training framework tailored for PCQA (CoPA), which enables the pre-trained\nmodel to learn quality-aware representations from unlabeled data. To obtain\nanchors in the representation space, we project point clouds with different\ndistortions into images and randomly mix their local patches to form mixed\nimages with multiple distortions. Utilizing the generated anchors, we constrain\nthe pre-training process via a quality-aware contrastive loss following the\nphilosophy that perceptual quality is closely related to both content and\ndistortion. Furthermore, in the model fine-tuning stage, we propose a\nsemantic-guided multi-view fusion module to effectively integrate the features\nof projected images from multiple perspectives. Extensive experiments show that\nour method outperforms the state-of-the-art PCQA methods on popular benchmarks.\nFurther investigations demonstrate that CoPA can also benefit existing\nlearning-based PCQA models.\n","authors":["Ziyu Shan","Yujie Zhang","Qi Yang","Haichen Yang","Yiling Xu","Jenq-Neng Hwang","Xiaozhong Xu","Shan Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10066v3.pdf","comment":null}]}}
